# The problem

We're a team of students with the idea to build a better future, strating from one of the most important problems to solve: **Cities**.

In the last decades the percentage of pollution in all cities and metropolis is constantly increasing, due to the continuous use of polluting vehicles and unsustainable energies. This big problem, thay has been undervalued for years, is now surfacing with all the releated consequences, i.e.

1. Increased mortality related to cardivascular and respiratory diseases

2. Rising global temperatures resulting in melting glaciers and increased natural disasters.

3. Continued extinction of animal species, caused by climate anomalies and/or continued predator migrations.

4. Disruption of natural ecosystems and destruction of animal habitats.

## We chose **#challenge15 - Urbanism**

![Futuristic and Sustainable city](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60041565/149778936-2f0efa26-99e9-41d7-8cd5-f0c01d060b43.jpg)

To try to solve all these problems, in the occasion of this proposal from our school, we decided to start working on a standard model of a futuristic city.

After having done some researches about more sustainable technologies, energies and matherials, we've found more sustainable matherials that can be used to build: houses, skyscrapers, streets and even tables, chairs and umbrellas.

# The solution

![Green City](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60041565/149777715-1c175b61-ebf3-4bb7-8dbf-17e7fdaa1972.jpg)

The weapon we need to use to fight the pollution and its releated problems are sustainable energies and the common sense of allÃ² the citizens.

## **The beginning of the pollution**

So we need to make big changes to our cities, which are the primary site where the most of daily activies take place. The problem of cities pollution began around 1920s, where there was an intensification of industrial activities, which used coal or oil as their primary energy source. Today most firms still use coal or oil as their primary energy source; This represents a very big problem for our planet.

The main place in which most industrial activities take place is the city which, to date, represents a serious problem for pollution that must be solved with timely interventions.

## **Sustainable energies**

The use of sustainable energies as primary energy sources prevents our planet to be destroied. Most atmospheric pollution comes from cities, more specifically

1. Pollution caused by smog from means of transport.

2. Pollution caused by the high consumption of methane and gas (380 million tonnes of methane per year, ISTAT).

3. Pollution from discharges of toxic waste by industry.

4. Pollution caused by the release of waste into the environment.

For this reason, we have created a **innovative**, **sustainable**, **modern** and **futuristic** model of a city. Free of sources of pollution, rich in greenery and eco-sustainable facilities, BASSO is the ideal city model that meets all the requirements to become a winning model of the future city.

BASSO offers all the comforts and services that every city can offer to its citizens, from municipal services to then arrive at an advanced monitoring and surveillance system of the city to ensure maximum security in the city.
