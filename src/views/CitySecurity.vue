      The security of cities is a subject of great importance that is at the
      basis of civility and peaceful coexistence. It is precisely for this
      reason that it is necessary to act in a timely manner by implementing
      reforms that are capable of improving the security system of the
      individual city.

      <br />For this reason, it is necessary to go beyond the police: Although
      necessary, they are not enough to ensure maximum safety. By analysing the
      current cases of crime in cities, it has emerged that there is a lack of
      surveillance in all places; for this very reason, an effective solution to
      this problem would be to encourage citizens to carry out, on a voluntary
      basis, a city surveillance.
