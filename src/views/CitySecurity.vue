      The security of cities is a subject of great importance that is at the
      basis of civility and peaceful coexistence. It is precisely for this
      reason that it is necessary to act in a timely manner by implementing
      reforms that are capable of improving the security system of the
      individual city.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg w-1/2 text-justify leading-relaxed">
      <br />For this reason, it is necessary to go beyond the police: Although
      necessary, they are not enough to ensure maximum safety. By analysing the
      current cases of crime in cities, it has emerged that there is a lack of
      surveillance in all places; for this very reason, an effective solution to
      this problem would be to encourage citizens to carry out, on a voluntary
      basis, a city surveillance.

          The good conduct of citizens will be rewarded with city credits,
          usable by the citizens themselves in shops and/ or supermarkets. These
          credits can be included in your Curriculum Vitae (C.V.) or presented
          to your school or university to demonstrate your social and civic
          contribution.

          The cityâ€™s surveillance corps is made up of qualified and specially

          All police officers will be trained periodically with refresher
          courses in which new techniques and practices will be shown to ensure
          maximum safety.
