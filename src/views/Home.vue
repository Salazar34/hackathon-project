          Cities, as primary places in the conduct of daily activities and with
          the highest concentration of movement, is the cause of most
          environmental pollution. The high concentration of polluting
          substances in the city allows a simple diffusion in every part of the
          atmosphere, thanks also to the intervention of the air currents. This
          leads to the spread of these substances throughout the world, causing
          serious problems:
